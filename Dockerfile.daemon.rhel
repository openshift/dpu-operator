# Build
# the GOARCH has not a default value to allow the binary be built according to the host where the command
# was called. For example, if we call make docker-build in a local env which has the Apple Silicon M1 SO
# the docker BUILDPLATFORM arg will be linux/arm64 when for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64. Therefore,
# by leaving it empty we can ensure that the container and binary shipped on it will have the same platform.

# Due to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/70329 cross-compilation hangs at times.
# As a temporary workaround, we can try specifying GOMAXPROCS=2 to relieve this issue
