# dpu-operator

Testing make-test

This operator will manage and configure data processing unit (DPUs) to be used in accelerating/offloading k8s networking functions

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Building and testing against a local cluster
If you want to start from the source, follow the steps below to build containers, push them to a local registry, and deploying to a cluster.

1. Configure and Build Containers

Run the following command to configure and build all the containers:
```sh
make local-buildx
```
2. Push Built Images to a Local Registry

Run the following command to push the built images to a local registry:
```sh
make local-pushx
```
3. Deploy to the Cluster

Run the following command to deploy the YAML files to the cluster based on `KUBECONFIG`:
```sh
make local-deploy
```

4. To deploy from a different registry, define the `REGISTERY` variable:

`make local-deploy REGISTERY=...`

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dpu-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dpu-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Local development
First, set up a registry on the local host to which you can push and from which you can pull in the cluster. Then, build, push and use local-deploy to deploy in your cluster.

```sh
make images-build
make images-push
make local-deploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
